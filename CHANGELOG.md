  - Fixed clippy warnings (using `is_none_or` instead of `map_or`)
  - Added `quick_test.sh` script for rapid testing
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive documentation improvements
  - Added security notices about RSA key sizes
  - Enhanced README with key highlights section
  - Updated test coverage information

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-22

### Added
- Custom error types (`ChatError`) for better error handling and debugging
- Binary message protocol supporting multiple message types:
  - Text messages (backward compatible)
  - File transfers with SHA256 verification
  - Commands (help, quit, send, info, nickname)
  - Status updates and progress tracking
  - Heartbeat for connection monitoring
- File transfer capability:
  - Send files up to 100MB (configurable)
  - Automatic integrity verification
  - Progress tracking
  - Auto-save to downloads directory
- Command system with built-in commands:
  - `/help` or `/?` - Show available commands
  - `/quit` or `/exit` - Exit gracefully
  - `/send <file>` - Transfer files

- Enhanced CLI with clap:
  - `--port` - Specify listening port
  - `--connect` - Connect to peer address
  - `--nickname` - Set display name
  - `--debug` - Enable debug logging
  - `--no-encryption` - Disable TLS (future use)
