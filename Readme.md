## What Makes This Special?

Unlike traditional chat applications that rely on central servers, **Rust P2P Chat** establishes direct TCP connections between peers. There's no "server" and "client" in the traditional sense - both peers are equal participants in the conversation. The first peer simply waits for a connection, while the second initiates it. Once connected, both peers have identical capabilities.

## Demo

Run `shell/test_mux.sh`:

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RustChat.git
cd rust-p2p-chat

# Build and run
cargo run --release
```

### Start Chatting in 30 Seconds

#### Option 1: Using Cargo (Rust installed)

**Terminal 1 (First peer):**
```bash
cargo run --release -- --port 8080
```

**Terminal 2 (Second peer):**
```bash
cargo run --release -- --connect localhost:8080
```

#### Option 2: Using Docker (No Rust required)

```bash
# Quick demo with docker-compose
docker-compose up

# Or run manually in two terminals:
# Terminal 1: docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/your-username/rust-p2p-chat --port 8080  
# Terminal 2: docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/your-username/rust-p2p-chat --connect host.docker.internal:8080
```

You are now chatting peer-to-peer with end-to-end encryption.

### Starting a Chat Session

Since this is a **true P2P application**, there's no permanent "server" or "client" - just two equal peers.

1. **First Peer (Listener):**
- Run the application
- Press Enter when prompted for peer address
- Enter a port number (default 8080)
- The peer will bind to `0.0.0.0:port` and wait for incoming connections

2. **Second Peer (Connector):**
- Run the application
- Enter the first peer's address in format `ip:port` (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8080`)
- Connection will be established automatically

**Important**: After connection is established, both peers are completely equal - they can both send and receive messages simultaneously.

### Example Session

**Terminal 1 (First Peer):**
```
$ cargo run
P2P Chat Application
Usage:
1. Start as server: just press Enter when prompted for address
2. Connect to peer: enter address as ip:port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080)

Enter peer address (or press Enter to start as server): 
Enter port to listen on (default 8080): 8080
Listening on: 0.0.0.0:8080
Waiting for peer to connect..
Peer connected from: 127.0.0.1:54321
Exchanging encryption keys..
End-to-end encryption enabled.
Type messages and press Enter to send (Ctrl+C to exit)
You: Hello from first peer.
Peer: Hi from second peer.
```

**Terminal 2 (Second Peer):**
```
$ cargo run
P2P Chat Application
Usage:
1. Start as server: just press Enter when prompted for address
2. Connect to peer: enter address as ip:port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080)

## Connecting Over the Internet

Since this is a direct TCP connection app, at least one peer needs a publicly accessible IP/port. Here are several ways to connect with friends over the internet:

### Method 1: Ngrok (Easiest - 2 minutes setup)

**Ngrok** creates a public tunnel to your local port. Perfect for quick chats.

1. **Install ngrok:**
```bash
# Download from https://ngrok.com/download
# Or use package manager
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok # macOS
snap install ngrok        # Linux
```

2. **You (host):**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the chat
cargo run -- --port 8080

# Terminal 2: Create public tunnel
ngrok tcp 8080
```

3. **Share with friend:**
Ngrok will show: `Forwarding tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 -> localhost:8080`

Your friend runs:
```bash
cargo run -- --connect 0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345
```

### Method 2: Port Forwarding

If you have router access:

1. **Configure router:**
- Access router admin panel (usually 192.168.1.1)
- Forward port 8080 to your local IP
- Find your public IP: `curl ifconfig.me`

2. **Start chat:**
```bash
cargo run -- --port 8080
```

3. **Friend connects:**
```bash
cargo run -- --connect YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:8080
```

### Method 3: VPN Solutions

Use a mesh VPN for a private network between devices:

- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)**: Easiest setup, free for personal use
- **[ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/)**: Open source alternative

Both give you and your friend private IPs that work as if you're on the same network.

### Method 4: Cloud VPS

Rent a small VPS (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode):

```bash
# On VPS
./rust-p2p-chat --port 8080

# Both you and friend connect to VPS
./rust-p2p-chat --connect VPS_IP:8080
```

### Method 5: Other Tunneling Services

- **[localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/)**: `lt --port 8080`
- **[bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore)**: `bore local 8080 --to bore.pub`
- **[serveo](https://serveo.net/)**: `ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 serveo.net`

### Current Limitations

This app uses direct TCP connections, requiring at least one peer to have a publicly accessible IP/port. For true P2P through NATs without configuration, future versions could implement:
- UDP hole punching
- STUN/TURN servers
- ICE negotiation
- WebRTC implementation

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

This application implements a **symmetric peer-to-peer architecture** where:
- Both peers run identical code
- No dedicated server process - any peer can listen or connect
- After handshake, the connection is fully bidirectional with no master/slave relationship
- Each peer maintains its own event loop for handling I/O

### Core Implementation Details

#### Asynchronous Runtime
- **Tokio Runtime**: Leverages Tokio's multi-threaded runtime for efficient async I/O
- **Zero-copy Operations**: Minimizes memory allocations during message passing
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Non-blocking I/O ensures responsive user experience

#### Connection Management
- **TCP Socket Handling**: Direct TCP stream manipulation for low-level control
- **Stream Splitting**: Uses `stream.into_split()` for separate read/write halves
- **Concurrent I/O**: Separate async tasks for reading and writing operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup on disconnection
- **Simultaneous Connect/Listen**: Can try connecting while accepting connections

#### Message Protocol
- **Binary Protocol**: Supports both plaintext (backward compatible) and binary formats
- **Message Types**: Text, EncryptedText, File, Command, Status, Heartbeat, Encryption
- **Direct Async I/O**: Uses `AsyncReadExt` and `AsyncWriteExt` for socket operations
- **Stream Processing**: Handles partial reads and message fragmentation
- **Large Buffer**: Configurable buffer size (default 8KB)
- **Automatic Serialization**: Uses bincode for efficient message encoding

#### Encryption Protocol
- **Automatic Handshake**: RSA public key exchange on connection
- **Session Keys**: Fresh AES-256 key generated for each session
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Keys are never transmitted in plaintext
- **Forward Secrecy**: New keys for every connection
- **Transparent Encryption**: Messages automatically encrypted when available

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Connection Resilience**: Gracefully handles network interruptions
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes user input and peer addresses
- **Comprehensive Error Types**: Detailed error reporting for debugging
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic cleanup on peer disconnection
- **Port Conflict Detection**: Helpful diagnostics when port is already in use

### Performance Characteristics
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Minimal runtime overhead (~2-5 MB)
- **High Throughput**: Can handle thousands of messages per second
- **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond message delivery on local networks
- **Scalable Architecture**: Could be extended to support multiple peers

## Quick Start Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start first peer
./rust-p2p-chat --port 8080

# Terminal 2: Connect to first peer
./rust-p2p-chat --connect 127.0.0.1:8080
```

```

### Send a File
Once connected, use the `/send` command:
```
You: /send ~/Documents/report.pdf
File sent
```

### Testing Encryption
The chat automatically establishes end-to-end encryption. To verify:

```bash
# Run the encryption test
cargo run --bin test_chat

# Output:
Created P2P chat instance
Encryption support: 1024-bit RSA + AES-256-GCM
Generated RSA keypairs
